# What is PowerTools Repo?
# PowerTools repository is a YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) repository available in some Linux distributions like CentOS, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux),
# and Oracle Linux. It contains additional software packages and dependencies that are not included in the main distribution repositories, but may be needed
# for certain tasks or applications.
# The PowerTools repository provides access to development tools, libraries, and additional software packages that may be required by software developers,
# system administrators, or power users. These packages may not be officially supported by the Linux distribution vendor, but are considered to be stable 
# and reliable by the community.
#
# What is CRB Repo?
# CRB is “Code Ready Builder” – PowerTools was a carryover from CentOS, which is still the equivalent of CRB in RHEL. CRB will be the repository name going
# forward in Rocky Linux and other derivatives starting with version 9. Rocky Linux 8 matches CentOS’s use of PowerTools in order to be as compatible as possible
# with what users expect from a rebuild of version 8. (Source: rockylinux.org)
